## Best Practices

### Understanding AI Interview Questions

When creating a job posting and setting up interviews, you don't need to prepare interview questions in advance. The AI interviewer intelligently generates questions on the fly based on the job description and adapts to candidate responses in real-time.

### Tip 1: Craft Detailed Job Descriptions

The quality of AI-generated interview questions directly correlates with your job description quality. For optimal results:

- Include detailed roles and responsibilities
- Specify experience requirements
- List both soft skills and hard skills needed
- For technical roles, detail the specific technology stack and tools
- Highlight any domain-specific knowledge required

A comprehensive job description ensures the AI interviewer asks relevant, high-quality questions tailored to your needs.

### Tip 2: Add Mandatory Screening Questions

If your organization has must-ask screening questions that need consistent coverage:

1. Use the **"Interview Questions"** feature to create custom questions
2. Attach these questions to the job posting
3. Mark them as mandatory

This ensures the AI interviewer consistently asks these critical questions to every candidate, maintaining standardization across your hiring process.

### Tip 3: Create Custom Evaluation Rubrics

For specialized evaluation criteria:

1. Create a custom rubric that reflects your organization's assessment standards
2. Attach the rubric to the job posting
3. The system will evaluate candidates based on your specific criteria

This provides consistency in evaluation and ensures alignment with your organizational values and requirements.

## Usage Statistics

**Tracked Metrics**:

1. **Screening Interview**: 
   - Shows interviews conducted vs. quota (e.g., "0 / 200 Used")
   - Tracks all AI-conducted candidate interviews

Each metric shows a clear format: `[Used] / [Total Quota] Used`

### Over-Quota Usage

**Important Billing Information**:

- The system **will not prevent** you from exceeding your monthly interview quota
- Conducting interviews over your plan limit incurs additional charges
- **Overage Fee**: $5 per interview conducted beyond your monthly quota
- Overage charges are added to your next monthly invoice

**Example**:
- Your plan includes 200 interviews/month
- You conduct 225 interviews in a month
- You'll be charged an additional $125 (25 interviews × $5) on your next bill

### Monitoring Best Practices

To avoid unexpected overage charges:

1. **Check Usage Regularly**: Monitor your usage statistics throughout the month
2. **Plan Ahead**: If you anticipate higher volume, consider upgrading your plan
3. **Set Alerts**: Contact support to set up usage alerts
4. **Upgrade Proactively**: Switch to a higher tier before reaching your limit

## Best Practices

### Organization Management

- **Keep Information Current**: Regularly update company details to ensure accurate candidate communications
- **Use Work Emails**: Always use professional email addresses for team members

### Team Collaboration

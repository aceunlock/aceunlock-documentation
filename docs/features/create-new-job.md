### Interview Configuration

1. **Match Complexity to Role**: Don't over-complicate interviews for entry-level positions
   - Entry-level: 15-20 minutes with Standard Screening
   - Mid-level: 20-30 minutes with Standard Screening
   - Senior-level: 30-45 minutes with deeper screening

2. **Choose Appropriate Interview Type**:

   - Let AI handle general conversation flow
   - Add custom questions only for must-ask screening items

### Questions and Rubrics

# AceUnlock for Hospitality & Hotels

In hospitality, your team IS your brand. Every employee represents your establishment, interacts with guests, and shapes customer experience. AceUnlock helps you hire high-quality, guest-ready staff at the speed your business demands.

## The Hospitality Hiring Challenge

### Your Employees Are Your Brand

In hotels, restaurants, and hospitality businesses:

- **First impressions matter** - Staff are the face of your establishment
- **Communication is critical** - Guest interactions require emotional intelligence
- **Presentation matters** - Appearance and demeanor reflect your brand
- **Attitude is everything** - One bad interaction can ruin a guest's experience

**Traditional hiring challenge**: How do you assess communication style, presence, and guest service aptitude at scale?

### The High-Turnover Reality

Hospitality faces unique workforce challenges:

- **60-80% annual turnover rate** - Industry average
- **Seasonal fluctuations** - Need to scale staff up/down quickly
- **High volume hiring** - Constantly recruiting for multiple positions
- **24/7 operations** - Need scheduling flexibility
- **Urgent needs** - Can't afford long hiring processes

**The Problem**: Traditional interviews are too slow for the pace of hospitality hiring.

### Speed vs. Quality: The Manager's Dilemma

**What you need**:
- ✅ Hire quickly to fill urgent gaps
- ✅ Assess communication and guest service skills
- ✅ Evaluate presentation and professionalism
- ✅ Screen for schedule flexibility
- ✅ Maintain quality standards

**What traditional hiring gives you**:
- ❌ Weeks of scheduling phone screens
- ❌ Can't assess presence over phone
- ❌ Time-consuming in-person interviews
- ❌ Delays for high-volume roles
- ❌ Inconsistent evaluation across managers

**The cost**: Hiring delays mean understaffing, overworked teams, and poor guest experiences.

## How AceUnlock Transforms Hospitality Hiring

### AI-Powered Video Interviews for Guest-Facing Roles

AceUnlock is purpose-built for high-volume hiring where communication, presence, and guest service skills are paramount.

### Why Video Interviews Matter for Hospitality

**What you can assess**:
- 📹 **Visual Presence**: How candidates present themselves professionally
- 💬 **Communication Style**: Clarity, tone, warmth, and articulation
- 😊 **Demeanor**: Friendliness, approachability, and guest service attitude
- 🎯 **Scenario Handling**: How they respond to guest service situations
- ⏰ **Schedule Flexibility**: Direct questions about availability and flexibility

**What phone screens miss**:
- Can't see professional appearance
- Can't assess non-verbal communication
- Can't evaluate camera presence (important for guest interactions)
- Can't gauge emotional warmth and friendliness

### The AceUnlock Advantage for Hospitality

#### 1. **High-Volume Interviewing at Scale**

**Challenge**: Need to hire 20 servers for summer season in 2 weeks

**Traditional Process**:
- 100 applications received
- Schedule 50 phone screens = 25 hours
- Schedule 20 in-person interviews = another 2 weeks
- Total time: 3-4 weeks minimum

**With AceUnlock**:
- 100 applications received
- All candidates interview on-demand within 48 hours
- Review top 20 performers (5 hours)
- In-person interviews with finalists (same week)
- **Total time: 1 week**

**Result**: Hire faster, don't lose great candidates to other opportunities

#### 2. **Assess Communication & Presence Before In-Person**

**The Problem**: Phone screens don't tell you if someone has the "it" factor for guest service.

**AceUnlock Solution**:
- **Video interviews** show you exactly how candidates present
- **See their smile**, hear their tone, observe their energy
- **Watch them handle** guest service scenarios
- **Evaluate professionalism** - appearance, setting, preparation

**Hiring Manager Benefit**: Only bring in candidates you KNOW have the right presence and communication style.

#### 3. **Screen for Schedule Flexibility Systematically**

**Critical for hospitality**: Need staff available for:
- Weekends and holidays
- Opening shifts (5 AM)
- Closing shifts (midnight)
- Variable schedules
- On-call availability

**How AceUnlock Helps**:
- **Add flexibility questions** to every interview
- **Custom rubric criterion**: "Schedule Flexibility & Availability"
- **Ask specific questions**:
  - "What days/times are you available to work?"
  - "Can you work weekends and holidays?"
  - "Are you comfortable with variable schedules?"
  - "How much advance notice do you need for schedule changes?"

**Result**: Filter out candidates with inflexible schedules BEFORE investing time in interviews

#### 4. **Evaluate Guest Service Scenarios**

**Sample Scenario Questions**:

**For Front Desk**:
- "A guest arrives at 10 AM but check-in isn't until 3 PM. They're upset and demand early check-in. How do you handle this?"

**For Servers**:
- "A guest complains their steak is overcooked and wants it remade. You know the kitchen is slammed. What do you say and do?"

**For Housekeeping**:
- "You're running behind schedule and a guest complains their room hasn't been cleaned yet. How do you respond?"

**For Concierge**:
- "A couple is celebrating their anniversary. They ask for restaurant recommendations but you're new to the area. What do you do?"

**What You Learn**:
- Problem-solving approach
- Guest-first mentality
- Communication under pressure
- Creativity and resourcefulness
- Empathy and emotional intelligence

#### 5. **Consistent Evaluation Across All Candidates**

**The Problem**: Multiple hiring managers = inconsistent standards

**With Custom Rubrics**:
Create evaluation criteria that matter for your roles:

**Example Front Desk Rubric**:
- Communication Clarity (20%)
- Professional Appearance (15%)
- Guest Service Attitude (25%)
- Problem-Solving (20%)
- Schedule Flexibility (20%)

**Example Server Rubric**:
- Personality & Warmth (25%)
- Menu Knowledge (15%)
- Upselling Ability (20%)
- Conflict Resolution (20%)
- Availability (20%)

**Result**: Every candidate is evaluated on the same criteria, ensuring fair and consistent hiring decisions.

## Best Practices for Hospitality Hiring

### 1. Always Use Video for Guest-Facing Roles

**Why**: You need to see how candidates present themselves. Phone screens miss:
- Professional appearance
- Smile and warmth
- Non-verbal communication
- Camera presence (translates to guest presence)

**Rule**: No in-person interviews without video interview first.

### 2. Create Role-Specific Scenario Questions

**Bad Question**: "How would you handle a difficult customer?"
**Good Question**: "A guest approaches the front desk at 2 AM complaining loudly about noise from the adjacent room. Other guests are nearby. What do you do?"

**Why Specific Scenarios Work**: Shows real problem-solving, not rehearsed answers.

### 3. Screen for Flexibility Early

**Add Questions**:
- "What days and times are you available?"
- "Can you work holidays? Which ones are you unavailable?"
- "How do you feel about split shifts?"
- "What's your ideal schedule?"

**Weight Heavily**: If flexibility is critical, make it 20-25% of your rubric.

### 4. Use Rubrics Consistently

**Don't**: Let each manager use their own criteria
**Do**: Create standard rubric, all managers use it

**Result**: Fair hiring, consistent quality, easier to defend decisions.

### 5. Review Videos, Not Just Scores

**The Score**: Tells you who passed your bar
**The Video**: Shows you WHO they are

**Watch For**:
- Genuine smile and warmth (can't fake this)
- Energy level (do they seem tired/disinterested?)
- Communication style (formal vs. casual vs. friendly)
- Setting (professional background? quiet space?)

### 6. Move Fast on Great Candidates

**Reality**: Great hospitality candidates get multiple offers

**When you see a star**:
- Call/text same day
- Offer in-person interview within 24 hours
- Make offer within 48 hours if possible

**AceUnlock helps**: You can review interviews 24/7, reach out immediately.

### 7. Track Quality Metrics

**Monitor**:
- 90-day retention rate (by hiring manager)
- Guest satisfaction scores (new hires vs. tenured)
- No-show rate to in-person interviews
- Time-to-fill per role

**Improve**: Use data to refine rubrics and questions.

- **Manager Time per Hire**: 4-6 hours

- **Hiring Manager Satisfaction**: High (consistent quality)

### ROI Calculation Example

**Scenario**: 50-room boutique hotel, hires 40 people/year

**Before AceUnlock**:
- 40 hires × 4 hours manager time = 160 hours
- 40 hires × $500 turnover cost (30-day quits) × 40% = $8,000
- No-show wasted time: 40 × 40% × 1 hour = 16 hours
- **Total Cost**: 176 hours + $8K turnover

**After AceUnlock**:
- 40 hires × 1.5 hours manager time = 60 hours
- 40 hires × $500 turnover cost × 20% = $4,000
- No-show wasted time: 40 × 5% × 1 hour = 2 hours
- **Cost**: $999/month × 4 months (seasonal hiring) = $3,996
- **Total Cost**: 62 hours + $4K turnover + $4K AceUnlock

**Savings**:
- 114 manager hours = $5,700 (at $50/hour)
- $4,000 reduced turnover
- **Total Savings**: $9,700 - $4,000 = **$5,700/year**
- **ROI**: 143% return on $4K investment

## AI Interviewer

### How does the AI Interviewer work?

The AI Interviewer conducts **adaptive  video interviews**:
1. Candidate receives interview link via email
2. Candidate opens link on any device (phone, tablet, laptop)
3. Candidate turns on their camera and microphone
4. AI asks questions via **audio** (spoken questions)
5. Candidate answers on camera - **video is recorded**
6. **AI listens to the response and adapts** - can ask follow-up questions based on what the candidate said
7. Process continues dynamically based on candidate responses
8. AI automatically saves and submits the interview
9. You review the recorded video interview with transcript

**Key feature**: The AI is **adaptive** - it tailors questions based on:
- The job description
- The candidate's responses
- Follow-up opportunities to dig deeper

It's **not a scripted Q&A** - it's an intelligent conversation where the AI probes for depth and clarity.

**Note**: You CAN configure it to use only pre-set questions without adaptation, but this is **not recommended** as you lose the benefit of dynamic follow-ups.

### Can candidates ask the AI questions?

**Yes!** Candidates can ask the AI Interviewer questions during the interview.

**How it works**:
- If the AI has knowledge about the question (company info, role details, process), it will **answer immediately**
- If the AI doesn't have the knowledge, it will acknowledge the question and say **"I'll note this for HR to follow up with you"**
- All candidate questions are recorded and visible to you in the interview review

**Examples of what AI can answer**:
- "What are the work hours for this position?" (if in job description)
- "Is this role remote or in-office?" (if specified in posting)
- "What's the next step in the hiring process?" (standard process info)
- "What benefits does the company offer?" (if provided in company settings)

**Examples of what AI defers to HR**:
- Specific salary questions beyond posted range
- Complex policy questions
- Custom requests or exceptions
- Questions requiring human judgment

Additionally, the **AI is adaptive** and will ask follow-up questions to candidates if their responses need clarification or more depth. For example:
- If a candidate gives a vague answer, the AI might say "Can you elaborate on that?"
- If a candidate mentions relevant experience, the AI might ask "Tell me more about that project"
- If an answer is unclear, the AI will probe for specifics

**Best practice**: Provide comprehensive job description and company information so the AI can answer most candidate questions.

### What types of questions can I ask?

You can provide initial questions or let the AI generate them based on the job description. The AI will adapt and ask follow-ups based on candidate responses.

**Question types that work well**:
- **Behavioral** - "Tell me about a time when..."
- **Situational** - "How would you handle..."
- **Technical** - "Explain how you would..."
- **Experience-based** - "Describe your experience with..."
- **Cultural fit** - "What motivates you?"
- **Scenario-based** - "A customer complains about X. What do you do?"

The AI will automatically:
- Ask follow-up questions based on responses
- Probe for depth where answers are shallow
- Request clarification when needed
- Adapt questions based on the job description

**Avoid**: Yes/no questions (though the AI will follow up if you use them)

**Note**: You can configure the interview to use only your pre-set questions without AI adaptation, but this is **not recommended** as you miss the benefit of dynamic, intelligent follow-ups.

### Do I need to add questions to a job posting?

**Short answer: Not required!** Only add specific questions if you have something that should **always** be asked to every candidate.

**Recommended approach**:
1. **Focus on writing a good job description** - Include role requirements, responsibilities, qualifications, and company details
2. **Let the AI generate questions** - The AI Interviewer is best at creating relevant questions based on the job description
3. **AI probes candidate knowledge** - It will ask follow-ups and dig deeper based on responses

**When to add specific questions**:
- ✅ **Must-ask questions** - "Can you work weekends?" (for retail/hospitality)
- ✅ **Compliance questions** - "Are you authorized to work in [country]?"
- ✅ **Key dealbreakers** - "Are you willing to relocate?"
- ✅ **Specific scenarios** - Company-specific situations you want all candidates to address

**When to let AI handle it**:
- ❌ Standard behavioral questions - AI will ask relevant ones
- ❌ Technical assessment - AI tailors to the role
- ❌ Experience validation - AI probes based on resume/job description
- ❌ General cultural fit - AI adapts to your company info

**Why AI-generated questions work better**:
- 🎯 **Tailored to each candidate** - Questions adapt based on their background
- 💡 **Dynamic follow-ups** - Probes deeper where needed
- 🔍 **Comprehensive coverage** - Ensures all key areas are explored
- ⚖️ **Consistent yet flexible** - Fair evaluation without being rigid

**Best practice**: Write a detailed, clear job description and let the AI do what it does best - conduct intelligent, adaptive interviews!

### How long should interviews be?

The interview length is **dynamic** because the AI adapts based on candidate responses. However, you can set guidelines:

**Recommended approach**:
- Provide **3-5 main questions** as starting points
- AI will ask follow-ups as needed (typically 1-3 follow-ups per main question)
- Total interview time: **15-30 minutes**
- Results in 85-90% completion rate

**What affects interview length**:
- Quality of candidate responses (detailed answers may trigger more follow-ups)
- Job complexity (technical roles may need more depth)
- AI adaptation settings

**Configuration options**:
- Set maximum interview time
- Set number of core questions
- Enable/disable adaptive follow-ups (though disabling is not recommended)

**Note**: Interviews longer than 35-40 minutes have higher abandonment rates.

### Can I use video in my questions?

Questions are audio-based (AI speaks the question). The candidate must be on camera to answer, and their video response is recorded. 

**Visual aids in questions** (diagrams, charts, etc.) are not yet supported but coming in 2025.

### In what languages does the AI Interviewer work?

Currently English only. Support for Spanish, French, German, and other languages coming in 2026. Contact support if you need multi-language support.

## Candidate Experience

### How do candidates feel about AI interviews?

Generally positive! Exit surveys show:
- **92% completion rate** - Most candidates finish the interview
- **4.3/5 satisfaction** - Candidates appreciate the convenience
- **"More convenient than phone screens"** - Most common feedback
- **"Appreciated the flexibility"** - Interview on their schedule

Some candidates find it unusual at first, but most adapt quickly.

### What if a candidate doesn't want to do an AI interview?

Candidates who decline AI interviews are typically not a good fit for modern, tech-forward companies. If a candidate cannot complete a simple video interview, they may struggle with:
- Virtual meetings
- Digital collaboration tools
- Remote work requirements
- Tech-enabled workflows

**That said**: You can offer phone screens as an alternative for exceptional candidates.

### What devices do candidates need?

Candidates can interview on:
- 📱 **Smartphones** (iOS or Android)
- 💻 **Laptops** (Windows or Mac)
- 🖥️ **Desktop computers**
- 📲 **Tablets** (iPad, Android tablets)

All they need is:
- Camera and microphone
- Internet connection
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)

### Can candidates redo their interview?

By default, **no** - candidates get one attempt. This ensures authenticity and prevents over-rehearsed answers.

**However**, you can enable "Allow Retake" for specific job postings if desired (e.g., for entry-level roles where candidates may be nervous).

### How long do candidates have to complete the interview?

You set the deadline when creating the job posting:
- **Typical**: 3-7 days
- **Urgent roles**: 24-48 hours
- **Passive candidates**: 14 days

Candidates receive reminder emails at 50% and 75% of the deadline.

### What if a candidate has technical issues?

Candidates can contact support via the interview page. Our support team helps with:
- Camera/microphone permission issues
- Browser compatibility
- Connection problems
- Account access issues

Support email: support@aceunlock.com

## Evaluation & Scoring

### How does the AI Evaluator score candidates?

The AI Evaluator uses your custom rubric to score each candidate:
1. **Reviews the transcript** of the candidate's answers
2. **Analyzes responses** against rubric criteria
3. **Assigns scores** for each rubric dimension (0-100)
4. **Calculates weighted average** based on your rubric weights
5. **Provides written feedback** explaining the scores

Scores are available within minutes of interview completion.

### How accurate is the AI scoring?

Very accurate for objective criteria (technical knowledge, structured thinking, communication clarity). 

**Best for**:
- Technical assessment
- Problem-solving methodology
- Communication skills
- Domain knowledge

**Less accurate for**:
- Cultural fit (subjective)
- Personality nuances
- Team chemistry
- Long-term potential

**Recommendation**: Use AI scoring for initial screening (top 20-30%), then human interviews for final assessment.

### Can I customize the evaluation rubrics?

Yes! Rubrics are completely customizable:
- Define your own criteria (e.g., "Technical Depth", "Client Communication")
- Set weights (e.g., Technical Skills 30%, Communication 25%)
- Adjust scoring thresholds
- Create different rubrics for different roles

[Learn about Evaluation Rubrics](../features/rubrics.md)

### What if I disagree with the AI's score?

You can:
1. **Override scores** manually (your score replaces AI score)
2. **Watch the video** to make your own assessment
3. **Adjust rubric weights** if AI consistently over/under-weights certain criteria
4. **Refine questions** to elicit better responses for evaluation

The AI score is a recommendation, not a final decision.

### Can I see why a candidate was scored a certain way?

Yes! Each candidate receives:
- **Overall score** (0-100)
- **Score breakdown** by rubric criteria
- **Written feedback** explaining scores
- **Transcript** of their responses
- **Video recording** of the interview

You have full visibility into the evaluation.

### How do I set the passing score threshold?

Start by reviewing your first 20-30 candidates without a hard threshold. Observe where your "definitely yes" candidates score. Set your threshold at the bottom of that range.

**Example**: If your strong candidates score 75-90, set threshold at 70.

You can adjust thresholds anytime based on candidate quality.

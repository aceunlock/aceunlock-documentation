# Quick Create Job Posting

Rapidly create job postings with AI-powered automation in just 3 simple steps.

## Overview

Quick Create is an AI-powered feature that streamlines the job posting creation process. This feature is especially useful when you already have a job posting created in another ATS (Applicant Tracking System) or on a job board. Simply copy and paste from the source, and our intelligent system will automatically extract and populate all the necessary fields, saving you valuable time while maintaining accuracy.

This feature is perfect for:
- Migrating job postings from other ATS systems or job boards
- Reposting jobs from external platforms (Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Creating job postings quickly when time is limited
- Maintaining consistency across similar positions
- Reducing manual data entry errors
- Getting job postings live faster

## Prerequisites

Before using Quick Create, ensure you have:
- An active AceUnlock account (recruiter or administrator role)
- A prepared job description (can be from your existing job postings or created fresh)
- Appropriate permissions to create job postings in your organization

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Paste Job Description

When you click the **Quick Create** button on the Job Postings dashboard, a modal dialog opens with the first step.

**What to do:**
1. Paste your complete job description into the text area
2. Ensure the description includes:
   - Job title
   - Location and employment type
   - Key responsibilities
   - Required qualifications and skills
   - Any additional relevant details
3. Click **Next** to proceed

**Tips for best results:**
- Use a well-structured job description with clear sections
- Include specific details about requirements and responsibilities
- The more comprehensive your description, the better the AI extraction

### Step 2: AI Processing & Review

Once you submit your job description, our AI engine analyzes the content and extracts key information.

**What happens:**
- The AI parses your job description in real-time
- Key details are identified and categorized
- The system validates the extracted information

**Possible outcomes:**

**Success:** If the AI successfully parses the job description, you'll see:
- A summary of extracted information
- Confirmation that all required fields were identified
- The option to proceed to **Review and Edit**

**Need Review:** If the AI encounters any ambiguities or missing critical information:
- You'll be notified which fields need attention
- Option to go back and refine your job description
- Guidance on what additional information is needed

**What to do:**
- Review the AI's extraction summary
- Click **Review and Edit** to proceed to the final step, or
- Click **Go Back** to modify your job description if needed

### Step 3: Review and Create

In this final step, you'll see the complete job posting form pre-filled with the AI-extracted information.

**What you'll see:**
- **Job Details**: Title, location, employment type, and deadline
- **Description**: Your original job description formatted and structured
- **Interview Settings**: Default interview configuration
- **Application Settings**: Standard application fields and processes

**What to do:**
1. **Review all fields** carefully for accuracy
2. **Edit any fields** that need adjustment or refinement
3. **Configure additional settings** if needed (optional):
   - Attach custom interview questions
   - Link evaluation rubrics
   - Select email templates
4. Click **Create Job Posting** to finalize

**What happens next:**
- The dialog closes
- Your new job posting appears in the Job Postings dashboard
- The posting is created in **Draft** mode by default
- You can publish it immediately or make further edits

## Best Practices

### Optimize Your Job Descriptions

For the best AI extraction results:

1. **Use Clear Headings**: Structure your description with sections like "Responsibilities," "Requirements," "Qualifications"
2. **Be Specific**: Include exact job titles, locations, and employment types
3. **List Skills Clearly**: Use bullet points for requirements and qualifications
4. **Include All Details**: Don't assume the AI will infer missing information

### Review Before Publishing

Even though the AI is highly accurate:

- Always review the extracted information before creating the posting
- Verify that the job title, location, and employment type are correct
- Check that the deadline is appropriate for your hiring timeline
- Ensure all critical requirements are captured in the description

### When to Use Quick Create vs. Create New Job

**Use Quick Create when:**
- You have an existing job description ready
- You need to create a posting quickly
- The job follows standard interview processes
- You're comfortable with default interview settings

**Use Create New Job when:**
- You need granular control over every setting
- The position requires custom interview configurations
- You want to attach specific questions and rubrics from the start
- You need to set up advanced application workflows

## Troubleshooting

### AI Parsing Issues

**Problem**: AI couldn't extract the job title
- **Solution**: Ensure the job title is clearly stated at the beginning of your description or in a "Title:" field

**Problem**: Location wasn't identified correctly
- **Solution**: Use standard location formats (e.g., "Remote," "New York, NY," "Toronto, ON, Canada")

**Problem**: Employment type is missing or incorrect
- **Solution**: Explicitly mention "Full-Time," "Part-Time," "Contract," or "Internship" in your description

### Dialog Not Opening

**Problem**: Quick Create button doesn't respond
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and refresh the page
- **Solution**: Verify you have appropriate permissions to create job postings
- **Solution**: Clear your browser cache and try again

### Missing Fields After Creation

**Problem**: Some information wasn't transferred to the job posting
- **Solution**: This information can be added manually by editing the job posting
- **Solution**: For future postings, include the missing details explicitly in your job description

## Tips for Efficiency

1. **Save Templates**: Keep successful job descriptions as templates for similar positions
2. **Batch Creation**: Prepare multiple job descriptions in advance and use Quick Create to process them rapidly
3. **Consistency**: Use Quick Create for similar roles to maintain consistency across your organization
4. **Iterate**: If the first attempt needs refinement, use the "Go Back" option rather than starting over

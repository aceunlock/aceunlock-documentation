## Before Your Interview

### 1. Research the Company

- 🏢 **Company website** - Mission, values, products/services
- 📰 **Recent news** - Google the company, check LinkedIn
- 💼 **LinkedIn** - Company page, employee profiles

## During Your Interview

### Technical Setup

✅ **Camera**:
- Position at eye level or slightly above
- You should fill about 60-70% of frame
- Leave a little space above your head
- Look directly at the camera when speaking

✅ **Lighting**:
- Face a window or lamp
- Avoid harsh overhead lights
- No backlighting (light behind you)
- Even, soft lighting is best

✅ **Background**:
- Clean and uncluttered
- Professional (home office, clean wall)
- No distractions (people walking by, TV)
- Neutral colors

✅ **Audio**:
- Use headphones/earbuds for better quality
- Test your microphone first
- Speak at normal volume
- Eliminate background noise

### Answering Questions

**Listen Carefully**:
- AI asks questions via audio
- Take a moment to understand fully
- Ask for clarification if needed

**Structure Your Answers**:
1. **Brief intro** (10-15 seconds) - Preview your answer
2. **Main content** (1-2 minutes) - Use STAR method, specific examples
3. **Conclusion** (10-15 seconds) - Summarize key takeaway

**Example**:
```
Question: "Tell me about a time you led a successful project."

❌ Bad: "Um, well, I led a lot of projects... there was this one time..."

✅ Good: "I'd be happy to share about a project I led last year. 
[Situation] I was the product manager for a mobile app redesign 
at XYZ Company with a 3-month deadline. [Task] The goal was to 
improve user retention by 25%. [Action] I coordinated a team of 
5 designers and developers, conducted user research, and implemented 
an agile workflow. [Result] We launched on time and increased 
retention by 32%, which translated to $500K in additional revenue. 
This taught me the importance of clear communication and user-centric design."
```

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Be **specific** - Use real examples, not generalizations
- ✅ Be **concise** - 2-3 minutes per answer is ideal
- ✅ Be **honest** - Don't exaggerate or lie
- ✅ Be **positive** - Even when discussing challenges
- ✅ **Quantify** - Use numbers when possible (% improvement, revenue, time saved)
- ✅ **Show growth** - Discuss what you learned

**What to Avoid**:
- ❌ Rambling - Stay on topic
- ❌ One-word answers - Elaborate with examples
- ❌ Negativity - Don't bash previous employers
- ❌ Jargon overload - Explain technical terms
- ❌ Vague answers - Be specific
- ❌ Reading scripts - Sound natural and conversational

### Body Language & Presentation

**Non-Verbal Communication**:
- 😊 **Smile** - Shows enthusiasm and friendliness
- 👀 **Eye contact** - Look at the camera, not your screen
- 🙌 **Gestures** - Use hands naturally (but don't be distracting)
- 🧍 **Posture** - Sit up straight, show energy
- 🎭 **Expressions** - Let your personality show
- 🔋 **Energy** - Match the enthusiasm level of the role

**Voice**:
- 🗣️ Speak clearly and at moderate pace

- 🚫 Minimize filler words ("um," "like," "you know")

**Appearance**:

- 💼 Dress for the role (tech startup vs. corporate)
- 👕 Solid colors work better than busy patterns

### Handling Follow-Up Questions

The AI is **adaptive** and will ask follow-ups. This is good!

**AI may ask for**:
- More details: "Can you elaborate on that?"
- Specific examples: "Tell me more about the project you mentioned"
- Clarification: "Can you explain what you mean by..."
- Deeper insight: "What was the impact of that decision?"

**How to handle**:
- ✅ Provide additional detail
- ✅ Give concrete examples
- ✅ Quantify when possible
- ✅ Stay relevant to the original question

**This shows**: Your depth of experience and knowledge

### Asking Your Own Questions

You can ask the AI Interviewer questions! Here's how:

**Good questions to ask**:
- "What does a typical day look like in this role?"
- "What are the biggest challenges facing the team?"
- "What opportunities for growth and development exist?"
- "Can you tell me about the team I'd be working with?"
- "What are the next steps in the hiring process?"
- "What's the company culture like?"
- "Is this role remote, hybrid, or in-office?"

**How to ask**:
- Pause and say "I have a question"
- Ask clearly and concisely
- AI will answer if it has the information
- If not, it will note it for HR to follow up

**What AI can typically answer**:
- Role details and responsibilities
- Work schedule and location
- Hiring process timeline
- General company information
- Benefits overview (if provided)

**What gets deferred to HR**:
- Specific salary negotiation
- Complex policy questions
- Custom requests
- Questions requiring human judgment
